== Preparing to generate the release ==
Install InnoDB Setup
Download and install the QuickStart Pack of Inno Setup from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php 

Checkout VisTrails git repository
In dist/windows/Input folder create a folder named x86
Copy python27.dll 32 bit version into the x86 folder
Inside the x86 folder create a folder called alps_libs

In dist/windows/Input folder create a folder named x64
Copy python27.dll 64 bit version into the x64 folder
Inside the x64 folder create a folder called alps_libs


== Custom Builds ==
Inside dist/windows/custom there are scripts for custom builds.

=== GDAL ===
Download the GDAL files from:
32-bit:
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/Download.aspx?file=release-1500-gdal-1-9-2-mapserver-6-2-0\gdal-19-1500-core.msi
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/Download.aspx?file=release-1500-gdal-1-9-2-mapserver-6-2-0\GDAL-1.9.2.win32-py2.7.msi
Install the first file. 

Install the second file to a custom Python27
installation (I believe it can be any folder on your hard drive). I
copied the installed python files to:
C:\Users\vistrails\extra_packages\gdal\x86\site-packages
I then went to the C:\Program Files (x86)\GDAL folder (created by the first
installer) and copied all the dlls into the osgeo folder inside
C:\Users\vistrails\extra_packages\gdal\x86\site-packages
Compiled all .py files with python -m compileall . inside the
site-packages folder

The script dist/windows/custom/vistrails_gdal.iss will copy the files
in the binary. Just execute Inno Setup as a normal release. It will
create a file called vistrails-gdal-setup.exe into
dist/windows/custom/Output

64-bit:
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/Download.aspx?file=release-1500-x64-gdal-1-9-2-mapserver-6-2-0\gdal-19-1500-x64-core.msi
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/Download.aspx?file=release-1500-x64-gdal-1-9-2-mapserver-6-2-0\GDAL-1.9.2.win-amd64-py2.7.msi

Install the first file. 

Install the second file to a custom Python27_64
installation (I believe it can be any folder on your hard drive). I
copied the installed python files to:
C:\Users\vistrails\extra_packages\gdal\x64\site-packages
I then went to the C:\Program Files\GDAL folder (created by the first
installer) and copied all the dlls into the osgeo folder inside
C:\Users\vistrails\extra_packages\gdal\x64\site-packages
Compiled all .py files with python -m compileall . inside the
site-packages folder

The script dist/windows/custom/vistrailsx64_gdal.iss will copy the files
in the binary. Just execute Inno Setup as a normal release. It will
create a file called vistrails-x64-gdal-setup.exe into
dist/windows/custom/Output
