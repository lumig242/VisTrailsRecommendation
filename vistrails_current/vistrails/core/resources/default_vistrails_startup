# VisTrails packages.

# VisTrails packages are collections of modules that provide user-specified
# functionality to VisTrails. Use addPackage to let VisTrails know which 
# packages you want enabled.

# Interpackage dependencies must currently be handled manually by the user.

# For example, the spreadsheet package depends on VTK for some functionality,
# so if you want that functionality, you should add the vtk package before
# the spreadsheet package.

# the vtk package is the main visualization package for VisTrails
# addPackage('vtk')

# pythonCalc is an example package intended simply to demonstrate how to
# create new packages
# addPackage('pythonCalc')

# ImageMagick uses the ImageMagick command-line suite to perform various
# tasks on images (conversion, filtering, etc).
#addPackage('ImageMagick')

# The spreadsheet package enables the Visualization Spreadsheet
# addPackage('spreadsheet')

# The HTTP package provides an easy way to access files from http and use
# them as regular files in VisTrails pipelines.
# addPackage('HTTP')

# The pylab (matplotlib) package for plotting and histograms
# addPackage('pylab')

# Hooks

# Currently, there is only one hook in VisTrails: the startup hook. By adding
# arbitrary callables to the startup hook, it is possible to run user-defined
# code after all packages have been initialized, but before VisTrails runs.

# This is intended to show that it is possible to have user-defined code
# in specific places in VisTrails. If you think you need a hook somewhere that
# we haven't allowed yet, please let us know, and we'll include it in a future
# release.

def testHook():
    """Prints the Module class hierarchy to stdout."""
    def printTree(n, indent = 0):
        def iprint(str):
            print '%s%s' % (" " * indent, str)
        iprint('Class: %s' % n.descriptor.name)
        for c in n.children:
            printTree(c, indent+4)
            
    import modules
    import modules.module_registry
    t = modules.module_registry.registry.classTree
