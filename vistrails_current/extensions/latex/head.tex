\begin{document}

This document shows examples of how to embed a vistrail from a local
file. The file is head.vt and it is located in the same folder as this
file.

To build the pdf version of this document, configure this file
according to your platform and from a terminal window type:
\begin{verbatim}
make head
\end{verbatim}

or
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex -shell-escape head
\end{verbatim}

Embedding the results of workflow \emph{aliases}:
\begin{center}
\vistrail[filename=head.vt,
version=15]{width=6cm}
\end{center}

Embedding the workflow \emph{aliases} as a pdf:
\begin{center}
\vistrail[filename=head.vt,
version=15,
pdf,
showworkflow]{width=6cm}
\end{center}

Embedding a workflow as a smart tag (if the tag changes to another
workflow, the new workflow will be used when the latex file is
compiled)
\begin{center}
\vistrail[filename=head.vt,
version=42,
tag={volume rendering},
buildalways]{width=6cm}
\end{center}

Embedding the complete tree:
\begin{center}
\vistrail[filename=head.vt,
buildalways,
showtree]{width=8cm}
\end{center}

%% Uncomment the following part part for accessing workflows directly
%% in a database

% Embedding workflow result:
