%% ifplatform for detecting which version of OS we are running on

%% This is to hide the border of the included image

\newwrite\pythonincludein

%% environment configuration to be set before executing vistrails
%% for example
%% \newcommand{\vistrailsenv}{DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH= }

%% leave it empty if you don't want to embed a link in the pdf
\newcommand{\vistrailsdownload}{}

%% full path to python or just python if it is on PATH
\newcommand{\vistrailspythonpath}{python}
