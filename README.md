# Scientific Workflow Recommendation
As current satellite measurements rapidly magnify the accumulation of more than 40 years of scientific knowledge, new discoveries increasingly require collaborative integration and adaptation of various data-driven software components (tools). In recent years, scientists have learned how to codify tools into reusable software modules that can be chained into multi-step executable workflows. However, although computing technologies continue to improve, adoption via the sharing and reuse of modules and workflows remains a big challenge.

This project at Carnegie Mellon University aims to tackle this challenge from a novel angle, to study how to leverage peer scientistsâ€™ best practice to help facilitate the discovery and reuse of Earth science modules developed by others.
